# Diabetes Prediction ML Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

- `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

  git clone <repository_url>

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).

3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab) and execute the cells to run the project.

4. **Input Data**: If you wish to test the predictive system, provide input data containing health parameters (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure, BMI) and run the prediction cell in the notebook.

## Dataset Information

The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset contains health-related data for female patients of Pima Indian heritage. It includes features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
